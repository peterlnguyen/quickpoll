  bar chart from d3: http://bl.ocks.org/Caged/6476579

- refactored into poll_retrieval, now hardcoded stuff makes integration testing difficult
  - need to test poll_retriever.retrieve_and_render_query and results,
    currently only testing the generic retrieve_poll function

- append question to poll url like stackoverflow e.g. "poll/what-hotel-to-go-to-for-vegas"
